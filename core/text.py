"""Shared Unicode text handling for Hindi (Devanagari) and Gujarati.

One tokenizer for chunking, BM25, and the guardrails so that "the same word"
means the same thing in every layer.

Two script-specific traps this module exists to avoid:

1. Python's ``\\w`` does not match Indic combining marks (matras are Unicode
   categories Mn/Mc, and ``str.isalnum()`` is False for them). Tokenizing
   Devanagari with a bare ``\\w+`` shatters words at every matra:
   ``हैबर`` -> ``['ह', 'बर']``. The explicit block ranges below prevent that.

2. The danda ``।`` (U+0964) and double danda ``॥`` (U+0965) sit *inside* the
   Devanagari block, so a naive ``[\\u0900-\\u097F]+`` range glues sentence-final
   punctuation onto the word: ``है।`` != ``है``. Those two code points are
   excluded so a word matches whether or not it ends a sentence.
